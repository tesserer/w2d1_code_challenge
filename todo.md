# JQUERY
- [x] source into html
- [x] Using jQuery, append a <div> element when you click the button.
- [x] Inside the <div> element you created in the previous step, create a <p> element that    shows how many times you have clicked the "Generate" button from the first step.
- [x] Inside the <div> element created in step two, append two <button> elements with text of "Swap" & "Delete".
- Clicking a "Swap" <button> should change its parent background-color from red to yellow.
- Clicking the "Swap" <button> on a yellow div should turn the background-color to red.
- Clicking a "Delete" <button> should remove its parent <div>.


# HTML

- [x] Create a <button> element on the DOM. Have the button text read "Generate".

Follow the steps below to complete the code challenge:

    Create a <button> element on the DOM, you may do this in jQuery, or write it directly in the HTML code. Have the button text read "Generate".

    Using jQuery, append a <div> element when you click the button.

    Inside the <div> element you created in the previous step, create a <p> element that shows how many times you have clicked the "Generate" button from the first step.

    Inside the <div> element created in step two, append two <button> elements with text of "Swap" & "Delete".

    In a CSS file, any <div> created using the "Generate" button should start with red as it's background-color.

    Clicking a "Swap" <button> should change its parent background-color from red to yellow.

    Clicking the "Swap" <button> on a yellow div should turn the background-color to red.

    Clicking a "Delete" <button> should remove its parent <div>.

No need to do anything beyond the challenge described above. Once you are complete, check your code into a GitHub repo and submit via this application.
